# DD_sequence
Hosts code for experimental realizations of dynamical decoupling (DD) schemes on NISQ-era quantum computers. We will first test the efficacy of "optimal" DD sequences found via a genetic algorithm (GA) by Quiroz and Lidar--hence the name of the repo, genetic algorithm dynamical decoupling (gadd).
